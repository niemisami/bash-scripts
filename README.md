# Bash scripts I have used for setting up Linux Mint 18 Sonya

Plan is to create reusable scripts for setting up basic settings like vim, git etc and programming environments

## Literature

I got inspired by O'Reilly's Bash Cookbook (ISBN: 978-0-596-52678-8)

 
## Scripts 
`playground.sh`: playing around with lovely bash
`mint-setup.sh`: running all neccessary scripts for setting up Mint (in the future)
`setup-git.sh`: install git and add my credentials to global config (prompt in the future?)
